== How to compile and install ==

For the arduino code you need the latest Arduino software (we used 1.6.4) and manually install the following libraries from 
the menu (Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries...):

- TimerOne
- TimerThree
- SD (by Arduino)

Then connect the AT-MEGA 2560 and compile and upload the software.


== Python utiltiy code ==

The python utility code has been written for python 2.7. You will need the following libraries to execute everything:

- Numpy + Scipy
- midi library from https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi


== State of the code ==

Because of time constraints not everything is well documented... sorry!
